gnm:     browseer for multifasta genome sequences with Vi/Vim like operation
         locate specific position, search sequences etc.

Compile and Install: With gcc, pthreads library, ncurses library available on Unix console,
         Change directory into the downloaded gnm directory and type  make
         Place the executable file "gnm" to where your PATH is set (such as /usr/local/bin).

Usage:   gnm input.fasta

Display: blackbar on top: Sequence Number / Total number of sequences on left
                          Title line of the fasta sequence displayed
         blackbar on bottom: From left; Cursor position, Region displayed, 
                                        Length of the sequence, File name
         inbetween blackbars: Nucleotide Sequence
         2nd bottom line: Input command line
         bottom line: system reports, like search results

Commands: (Return key is expressed as "<" here)
  
  Move: cursor to specific position of specific sequence

    5:300<   move to position 300 of sequence 5
    3:<      move to position 1 of sequence 5
    :300<    move to position 300 of the current sequence
     
    Just like Vi/Vim hjkl keys work as left, down, up, right (cursor keys works as well)

    l        one base forward
    k        one line up

    numbers prior to hjkl works as well as vim 
  
    10j      10 lines down
    3h       3 base forward
    5l       5 base backward

    Ctrl-f   one page forward
    Ctrl-b   one page backward
    Ctrl-u   half page up
    Ctrl-d   half page down

    L        move to the next sequence     (at first base)
    H        move to the previous sequence (at first base)

  Mark: mark cursor position with alphabet letters (a-z, A-Z) 

    ma       current cursor position is set as 'a', the marked position is displayed reverse
    'a       move to the marked position set to 'a' from anywhere 
             (a single quart followed by a letter)
    
  Visual: select continuous base positions and specify the area with alphabet letters
          specified area can be used as search query, described later

    v         specify the cursor position as one end. V is indicated on upper left corner
    vb        after moving the cursor, specify the position as another end of the region
              and set the area as 'b'
    `b        moveto the first position of the area from anywhere 
              (a back quart followed by a letter)

  Search: carries out sequence search.
           < 10bp: find hits one by one
           > 10bp: find all hits at first (takes few seconds for the first search)
           hit sequence highlighted by light blue. light red for reverse complement hit
           the highlighted color can be erased by reset commands described later
           Search with capital letters (ATGC) hits both capital and lower case letters
           Search with lower case letters (atgc) hits only lower case letters

    /ATGC<   Search ATGC forward
    ?ATGC<   Search ATGC backward
    n        Search the same sequence forward
    N        Search the same sequence backward

    /2ATGCGCCTGG<    Search ATGCGCCTGG allowing upto 2base mismatches
                     Mismatch bases are displayed with darker background
                     Takes few seconds for the first search because the query is > 10bp

    /vb<     Search sequence set as 'b' with the visual mode
    /v1m<    Search sequence set as 'm' with the visual mode allowing upto 1 mismatch

  Reset: rest attributes of marked positions, selected areas by visual, and search results
    rr or ra    resets all
    rm          resets marked positions
    rv          resets marked areas by visual mode
    rf or rs    resets search (find) results

Quit:

    :q<     ends gnm
